CHATGPT-3 - CHATBOT - HOW TO USE

- First, get your own OpenAI API key, by visiting https://platform.openai.com/ sign up using an account with a phone number in a supported country. Then, go to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys to get your own API keys, follow the instruction, copy it somewhere, and don't share it with anyone.

 - Second, fill out the OPENAI_API_KEY parameter in the constants.py file with your API key.

 - Third, open the terminal and run the following commands:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

 - Finally, on the same terminal run the following commands and start using the chatbox:

    python main.py

   It will print out instruction.

 - Some parameters in the constants.py file can easily be changed, including the voice, age, speech rates and of cource, the OpenAI keys. Don't change anything else if you don't know what you're doing.

The code is fairly simple, you can view it and start building a more sophisticated one.
